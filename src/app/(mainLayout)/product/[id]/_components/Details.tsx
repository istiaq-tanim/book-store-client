              For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a
              quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when
              handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately
              suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what
              they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years
              alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the
              gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns
              to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become
              intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new
              life–until the unthinkable happens.

              Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where
              the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural
              world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale
              of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by
              the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the
              beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps
